# Unhandled Runtime Error in Next.js Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where an unhandled runtime error occurs within a page component.  The error stems from referencing a variable that hasn't been defined.

## The Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to log an undefined variable (`undefinedVariable`) to the console. This results in a runtime error in the browser when the '/about' page is accessed.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all variables used within a component are properly defined before being accessed.  This can be achieved through several methods such as:

*   Properly declaring variables.
*   Implementing error handling (try...catch).
*   Using optional chaining (?.) to safely access potentially undefined properties.

This repository provides a corrected version (`aboutSolution.js`) that addresses the issue.
